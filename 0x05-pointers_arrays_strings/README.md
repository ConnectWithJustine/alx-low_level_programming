## 0x05 C - Pointers arrays and strings
---
### What are  pointer ?
* A pointer is a variable whose value is the address of another varible. or  a variable which contains a memory address.

### What are array
* Array is a kind of data structure that can store a fixed-size sequential collection of elements of the same type.

### What are the differences between pointers and arrays?

* Memory Allocation: Arrays are contiguous blocks of memory allocated statically or dynamically at compile time. pointers, on the other hand, are variables that store the memory address of another varible.

* Size: An array has a fixed size that is determined at compile-time. Pointers do not have a fixed size; thry can point to any memory location depending on the size of the data type they are pointing to.

* Memory Management: Arrays are automatically deallocated when they go out of scope. Pointers, on the other hand, must be explicitly deallocated using the free() function to prevent memory leaks.
