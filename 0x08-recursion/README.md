# 0x08. C - Recursion

## Description
What you should learn from this project:

* What is recursion
Recursion, in general, can be defined as the repetition of a process in a similar way until the specific condition reaches

* How to implement recursion
Recursion is implemented using stack because activation records are to be stored in LIFO order i.e. last in first out

* In what situations you should implement recursion
Recursion is made for solving problems that can be broken down into smaller, repetitive problems. It is especially good for working on things that have many possible branches and are too complex for an iterative approach.
