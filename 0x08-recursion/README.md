## Summary of Recursion:

### Recursion is a programming technique in which a function calls itself to solve a problem. It involves dividing a problem into subproblems of the same type until the subproblems become simple enough to be solved directly.

### Recursion can be implemented in most programming languages by defining a function that calls itself. The function should have a base case that stops the recursion and returns a result. The recursive case should reduce the problem to a smaller subproblem and call the function again with the subproblem as the argument.

### Recursion is useful when a problem can be broken down into smaller subproblems of the same type. It can simplify code and make it more readable when compared to iterative solutions. Recursion is often used in mathematical problems, data structures, and algorithms such as searching and sorting.

### However, recursion can be inefficient in terms of memory usage and processing time when compared to iterative solutions. Recursive solutions can also be harder to debug and understand due to the possibility of infinite recursion or stack overflow errors. In general, recursion should be used only when it simplifies the solution and improves code readability.
